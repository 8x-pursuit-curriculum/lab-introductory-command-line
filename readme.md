# Introductory Command Line Lab

It's time for you to practice navigating around the command line.

## Instructions

### Downloading this Lab

1. From the repository homepage on GitHub, click the green "Code" button. Then, click "Download ZIP".

1. Unzip the downloaded file. It will create a folder of the same name in your Downloads folder.

1. Navigate to the folder and open it with VSCode. Then, follow the instructions below.

### Completing this Lab

For each of the tasks below, you will need to follow the steps exactly. Then, you'll use the `history` command as described below to get a print out of the last commands you ran. Each line printed out should match one of the instructions. If it didn't work exactly right, practice again!

Copy the output from the `history` command into the `my-solution.md` file in the appropriate location. You will then upload this file to Canvas.

If you are asked to create any directories or files in the tasks below, you may delete them _after you have submitted this lab._
